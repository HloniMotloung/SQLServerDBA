/*
This script creates a full backup of the "MyDB" database and saves it as a file called "MyDB.bak" in the "C:" drive. 
The "WITH FORMAT" option initializes the backup and overwrites any existing backup file with the same name. The "MEDIANAME" and "NAME" options provide a name for the backup set and the backup media, respectively.

You can also schedule this script to run automatically using SQL Server Agent.

Note: This script will only work if the SQL Server user running the script has the necessary permissions to create backups.
